                    <h1>Accessibility Policy</h1>
                    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 5, 2025</p>
                    <p>At Moore Insurance, we believe everyone deserves equal access to information, products, and services—regardless of ability. That’s why we’re committed to providing a website experience that is accessible, inclusive, and user-friendly for all visitors.</p>

                    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                    <p>Moore Insurance strives to ensure our website meets or exceeds the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Level AA. These guidelines are recognized globally as the standard for improving web accessibility for people with disabilities.</p>
                    <p>We are actively working to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide consistent keyboard navigation</li>
                        <li>Maintain readable text and color contrast</li>
                        <li>Ensure all form elements are properly labeled</li>
                        <li>Make content adaptable across screen sizes and devices</li>
                        <li>Support assistive technologies like screen readers</li>
                        <li>Avoid time-based content restrictions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Ongoing Efforts</h2>
                    <p>Accessibility is not a one-time fix—it’s a continuous effort. We regularly audit our site for accessibility barriers and update content, code, and design practices to keep up with evolving standards.</p>
                    <p>If a known issue arises, we prioritize fixing it as quickly as possible.</p>

                    <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
                    <p>Some areas of our website may include third-party tools or plugins. While we aim to only use accessible technology, we do not control third-party platforms and cannot guarantee their full compliance. However, we welcome your feedback on any accessibility issues you may encounter.</p>
